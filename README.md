Prototype for a War Game

The application under development is an online turn based simulator for tabletop
miniatures skirmish game, a type of war game. The game is based around the movement 
of individual squad members and their actions such shoot and fight. The success of 
actions is based on a roll of D100 (100 sided die)

==================================================================================
==================================================================================

This prototype was created to verify the practical feasibility of the MVC pattern
for the game.
The code is not intended to be a first version of the game but rather a basis
for further development.


==================
HOW TO BUILD
==================

To compile the code the Makefile provided should be used
To run the program, after compiling (make) you should run the command make run

===================
Prerequisites 
===================

There are no specific prerequisites to run the code. However, due to the fact that 
modern C++ was used to implement the prototype, to build the code the compiler used 
should have support for the C++14 features.
